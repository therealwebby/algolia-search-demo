Question 1: Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."
Cheers, George

Hi George,

Thanks for getting in touch, more than happy to help you out.

To help clarify, records are individual items of data. This is the information that users want to find, it comes directly from your database.

Indexing, on the other hand, is how that data is organized for Algolia. Indexing organises the records so that it is quickly accessible for users.

In regards to Custom Rankings, there a number of things we could include to make Algolia’s algorithm provide more relevant search results. Commonly these are metrics such as views or likes but could be something more bespoke to your data set.

It would be great if you could let me know what kind data fields you have available as well as what sort of experience you would like to give your users so we can get a better idea of what we can do for you.

Maybe we could have a chat this week and go into a bit more detail?
Let me know when works for you, and feel free to get in touch if you have any more questions.

Best,
Alex

Question 2: Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your email, we always appreciate feedback both positive and negative.

I’ll pass your feedback to the product team who will take it into account as we continue to build Algolia.

We have made a few other improvements to the workflows in the latest update that might help you. I’d be happy to discuss other ways of using Algolia to see if there is any way we could improve the way you work with indexes.

Best,
Alex

Question 3: Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high-level process look like?
Regards, Leo

Hi Matt,

That’s good news, more than happy to help you understand more about the process.

Integrating Algolia is fairly straightforward. We have multiple SDKs for most popular platforms which you can use to integrate with what you have already.

To get started quickly with Algolia, sign up for an account on your website and use the dashboard to upload the data which you want your users to be able to search.

Once the data is available in the Algolia platform, you can use our SDK to query that data and start getting results. We have a number of tools help organise the way in which that data can be surfaced ensuring that your search results are as useful as possible.

I’d be more than happy to talk through your project and see how we can build an implementation that works for your product and ensure you get the most out of Algolia.

Best,
Alex
